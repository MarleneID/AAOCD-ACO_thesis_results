There is a large gap on the left and on the right. It goes beyond the border of the window so that I have to scroll to the right to see everything.
If you scroll down, the headers of the columns should still be visible so that you know in which column you are without having to scroll up again.","Each reference should be in its own line within the cell to improve the overview. It is difficult to read them if they are just separated by a space.
It would be nice to not just have a link to the entry in the literature list but also a direct link to the publication's website, e.g. by making the DOI clickable.
The literature entries do not give information about the day and month, so sorting the entries was quite demanding since I had to look each entry up online to find the exact date.
The columns and rows need a main header so that it is clear that rows show algorithms whereas columns name use cases.","It is a bit strange that the literature entries are assigned Latin numbers.
The questionnaire does not allow you to assign the same task load to multiple questions, e.g. you cannot assign a task load of 21 both for mental and physical demand.
There were 13 entries for Random Walk Algorithmen but the questionnaire only allowed to specify 12.
The table is really nice for identifying research gaps. Empty cells show combinations of algorithms and use cases that nobody has investigated before."

Then you need to scroll up again to see it. It would be easier if the column description would be shown always at the top of the page, even when scrolling down.

In my opinion the references below the table could be separated a bit more. Currently there is no extra free line or space between the single reference items, which makes it a bit harder to see when the next item begins.

Links such as doi.org could be clickable.","The automatical scrolling to the clicked reference is very nice and the table gives a good overview."
