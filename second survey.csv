If you look at it with a PC monitor, there is quite a lot of whitespace on the left and right that could have been used. Instead, more scrolling inside of the table is necessary. It also creates the need to scroll sideways more which is always a bit cumbersome as there is no mouse wheel for this action.

It is also a bit unintuitive to scroll the panel with the table inside of the scrollable page. Depending on the mouse position, you either scroll the entire page (but not the table) or you only scroll the table. At some point when scrolling down with the mouse inside the table's panel, the table reaches its end and you suddently start scrolling the entire page. This action cannot immediately be undone because simply scrolling up will not scroll the page back up but the table. Instead, you have to move the mouse out of the table and then scroll up to have the table in full view again.

The list of references could be formatted better, e.g. by making the enumerators bold or introducing gaps in-between two entries. At the moment, the reference list is a wall of text where it is quite difficult to distinguish where one entry ends and another one begins. This effect is strengthened by the Roman numbers which do not stick out among the rest of the letters, e.g. abbreviated names. An enumeration with bold Arabic numerals and a slight gap between entries could help making the literature list clearer.","Despite the strangeness of the scrollable panel in which the table is placed, it now has fixed headers that stay visible while scrolling. This is a large improvement regarding usability as you always see the headings of each row and column. If I had to choose, I would prioritize the visibility of the table and row headings over easier scrolling as I am able to accustom to the scrolling - you just have to pay attention where you put your mouse cursor while scrolling. In this regard, I would say that this version is better than the one of the first evaluation.

It is really helpful that the dois are now clickable as this really eases the effort to look up further information about the paper, e.g. its publication date. You can simply click on it and do not have to copy paste it.

The meaning of the row's and column's headings is now also clear because of the cell in the left top which now describes the row and column categories.

It would maybe be worth having an optional ""fullscreen"" button which leads to a web page that only contains the table and nothing else. This way, you can leverage the entire screen's space and let the user explore it in detail. If you click on one of the reference links, it takes you back to the reference list.

Overall, this iteration is definitely an improvement compared to the version of the first evaluation."
