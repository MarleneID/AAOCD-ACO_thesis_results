-A pragraph mark after every entry would make the table much more readable.

-Tables with a lot of rows always have the problem the you can't see the column captions anymore after scrolling down to far. That makes them sometimes a bit cumbersome to use.  A nice way around this is to make the column captions detachable from the table, so they automatically stay on top of the screen.",""
